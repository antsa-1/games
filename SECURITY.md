## Reporting a Vulnerability

Interested hearing about all possible bugs/threats related to code. Especially security and (backend) multithreading issues. Backend validates user input data.
* Traffic is in localhost plain http which in production environment should be changed to TLS even though there are no sensitive information involved (except password).
* WebSockets can use TLS (wss -protocol) if site has domain name with SSL certificate.
* Self signed certifictes are not supported by common browsers and are not used.
* Applications login and registration functionalities are delayed on purpose. In theory a WAF could be configured in front the REST-api functionalities.

Issues can be created in GitHub issues tab, all are appreciated.
